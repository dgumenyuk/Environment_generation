Every folder contains the three search algorithms implementations. The results are summurized in jupyter notebooks.  
To run the nobooks you can use the [tool](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), where you need to enter the jupyter notebook url to view it.
To run the experiment, you should launch the *Optimize.py* in the corresponding folder:

```bash
python Optimize.py
```
